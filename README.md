This model preprocesses text data by performing cleaning and tokenization, followed by conversion into numerical format using TfidfVectorizer. It trains and evaluates multiple classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, on the processed data. The model provides real-time sentiment predictions based on user input and visualizes classifier performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
